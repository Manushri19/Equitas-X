# EQUITAS-X: AI Fairness Prototype ‚öñÔ∏èü§ñ

## ‚ú® Overview

EQUITAS-X is a modular, open-source prototype designed to detect, mitigate, and audit AI bias, specifically within the context of **hiring processes**. It provides a hands-on introduction to building ethical and responsible AI systems, combining state-of-the-art techniques with user-friendly interfaces. This prototype is a stepping stone towards a fully realized AI fairness ecosystem powered by decentralized governance and advanced machine learning.

## üöÄ Key Features

*   **Bias Detection:** Identifies statistical disparities in your hiring data using metrics from the AIF360 toolkit.
*   **Adversarial Debiasing:** Reduces bias during model training using adversarial learning techniques.
*   **Synthetic Data Augmentation:** Generates fairness-optimized synthetic data to address underrepresentation and "bias vaccination."
*   **Simplified Blockchain Audit:** Demonstrates a basic smart contract framework for logging and challenging AI decisions.
*   **Interactive Explainability Dashboard:** Visualizes fairness metrics and provides SHAP-based explanations of model behavior through a Streamlit interface.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.7+
*   `pip` package manager
*   (Optional) Solidity compiler for blockchain component
*   Basic understanding of AI/ML concepts

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/equitas-x.git
    cd equitas-x
    ```

2.  Install the required Python packages:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

1.  Prepare your hiring data in CSV format. Ensure it includes features relevant to the hiring decision and a column indicating the "hired" status.

2.  Run the main script:

    ```
    python equitasx.py --dataset your_hiring_data.csv --protected gender --audit-level 3
    ```

    *   `--dataset`: Path to your CSV file.
    *   `--protected`: Name of the protected attribute column (e.g., "gender", "race").
    *   `--audit-level`: Level of audit logging (1-3, higher is more verbose).

3.  Launch the Streamlit dashboard:

    ```
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

    Open your browser to the displayed URL (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

## üß© Module Breakdown

*   **`equitasx.py`:** Main script orchestrating the bias detection, mitigation, and audit processes.
*   **`aif_utils.py`:** Wrappers for AIF360 functionalities.
*   **`synthetic_data_gen.py`:** Code for generating synthetic datasets with ethical constraints using SDV.
*   **`blockchain/contracts/BiasAudit.sol`:** Example Solidity smart contract for audit logging.
*   **`app.py`:** Streamlit dashboard for visualization and interaction.
*   **`requirements.txt`:** Python package dependencies.

## üß™ Testing

The prototype includes basic unit tests (using `unittest` or `pytest`, add instructions here). To run tests:
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p "*_test.py"

## üìà Expected Results

Running EQUITAS-X should demonstrate:

*   Quantifiable bias metrics in your dataset *before* and *after* mitigation.
*   Visualizations highlighting feature distributions and model behavior.
*   A simulated blockchain audit log of AI decisions.
*   An increase in fairness metrics without significant accuracy loss.
